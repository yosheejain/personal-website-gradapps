::: {#hero-heading}

I am a junior pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a passion for research in Human-Computer Interaction, CS Education, and Applied AI/ML. My research interests are in designing human-centered systems that can integrate computing as a tool in real-world applications. I want to design educational technology tools so that all students can engage with computing in ways relevant to their learning objectives and meaningful for their future goals. The following is a non-exhaustive list that summarizes my technical skills and tools I've worked with! Feel free to reach out to me to chat about any of these or anything else!
