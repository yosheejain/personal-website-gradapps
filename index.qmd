::: {#hero-heading}

I am a junior pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a passion for research in Human-Computer Interaction, CS Education, and Applied AI/ML. My research interests are in designing human-centered systems that can integrate computing as a tool in real-world applications. I want to design educational technology tools so that all students can engage with computing in ways relevant to their learning objectives and meaningful for their future goals. The following is a non-exhaustive list that summarizes my technical skills and tools I've worked with! Feel free to reach out to me to chat about any of these or anything else!

```{r write-manual-redirects}
#| eval: true

manual_redirects <-
  readr::read_table(here::here("static", "_manualredirects.txt"),
                    col_names = FALSE) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(redirect = paste0(X1, " ", X2, " ", X3))

manual_redirects <- manual_redirects$redirect

# write the _redirect file
writeLines(manual_redirects, here::here("_site", "_redirects"))

```
